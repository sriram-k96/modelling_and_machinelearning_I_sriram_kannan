Homework - 7
================
Sriram Kannan

1.  Work through the “Image Classification” tutorial on the RStudio
    Keras website.

2.  Use the Keras library to re-implement the simple neural network
    discussed during lecture for the mixture data (see nnet.R). Use a
    single 10-node hidden layer; fully connected.

3)Create a figure to illustrate that the predictions are (or are not)
similar using the ‘nnet’ function versus the Keras model.

4.  (optional extra credit) Convert the neural network described in the
    “Image Classification” tutorial to a network that is similar to one
    of the convolutional networks described during lecture on 4/15
    (i.e., Net-3, Net-4, or Net-5) and also described in the ESL book
    section 11.7. See the !ConvNet tutorial on the RStudio Keras
    website.
